Writing Instructions for Finding the Upstairs Bathroom:
This exercise is about thinking in terms of explicit steps, as a computer would require. 

House Layout:

A two-story house with a living room, kitchen, and bathroom downstairs, and a bedroom and an upstairs bathroom.
You start at the front door, the stairs are straight ahead, and the upstairs bathroom is down a hallway to the left.

Instructions:

Stand at the front door, facing forward.
Open the front door.
Step inside and close the door behind you.
Turn 90 degrees to your right to face the stairs.
Walk forward 10 steps toward the base of the stairs.
Place your right hand on the stair rail.
Lift your left foot and step up onto the first stair.
Repeat this motion for each of the next 14 stairs.
Upon reaching the top, turn 90 degrees to the left.
Walk forward 5 steps until you reach a hallway.
Turn left and walk forward 8 steps.
The bathroom door is on your right. Turn the doorknob and push to open it.
Step inside the bathroom.

Additional steps (for clarity): Some assumptions (like knowing how to turn a doorknob, or which foot to step with) may need to be detailed more explicitly, especially for a "computer."
