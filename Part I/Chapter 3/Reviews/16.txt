Q)  What is the function of each part of the header line in a for-loop, and in what sequence are they executed?


A)  The for-loop header has three parts:
    
    Initialization (int i = 0): Executed once at the beginning.
    
    Condition (i < n): Checked before each iteration; loop continues if true.
    
    Update (i++): Executed after each loop iteration.
    
    The sequence is: Initialization → Condition check → Loop body → Update.
