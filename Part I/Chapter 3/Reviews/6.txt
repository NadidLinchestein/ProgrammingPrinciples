Q)  What is an lvalue? List the operators that require an lvalue. 
    
    Why do these operators, and not the others, require an lvalue?


A)  An lvalue (left-value) is an object that can appear on the left side of an assignment operator.
    
    Operators requiring lvalues: Assignment operators (=), increment/decrement (++, --), 
                                 and compound assignment operators (+=, -=, etc.).
    
    These operators require an lvalue because they modify the contents of a memory location.
