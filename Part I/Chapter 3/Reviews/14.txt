Q)  When would a programmer prefer a switch-statement to an if-statement?


A)  A switch-statement is preferred when there are multiple discrete conditions based on the value of a single variable, typically integer or character values. 
    
    It can be more efficient and easier to read than multiple if-else statements for these cases.
