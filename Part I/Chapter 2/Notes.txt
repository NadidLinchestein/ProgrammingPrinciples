Conversions are of two kinds
    widening: Conversions that preserve information, such as char to int.
    narrowing: Conversions that may lose information, such as int to char.


When we need narrowing, 
we can use narrow<T>(x) to check that x can be narrowed to a T without loss of information. 


When we want rounding, 
we can use round_to<int>(x). Both are supplied by PPP_support.


C++ offers four notations for initialization:
    int x0 = 7.8;      // narrows, some compilers warn
    int x1 {7.8};      // error: {} doesn’t narrow
    int x2 = {7.8};    // error: ={} doesn’t narrow (the redundant = is allowed)
    int x3 (7.8);      // narrows, some compilers warn
