Q)  What notations can you use to initialize an object?


A)  In C++, you can initialize an object using:

    Copy Initialization: Uses the assignment operator, e.g., int x = 5;
    Direct Initialization: Uses parentheses, e.g., int x(5);
    Brace Initialization (Uniform Initialization): Uses braces and helps prevent narrowing conversions, e.g., int x{5};
    
    Each notation has its use cases, but brace initialization is often preferred for consistency and safety in modern C++.
