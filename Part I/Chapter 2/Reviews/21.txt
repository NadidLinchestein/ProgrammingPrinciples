Q)  Give five examples of legal names that you shouldnâ€™t use because they are likely to cause confusion.


A)  Some legal names that could cause confusion due to their similarity to keywords or common terms include:

    int (could be mistaken for the int data type)
    float (could be mistaken for the float data type)
    temp (too generic, not descriptive)
    count (could be unclear if not scoped properly)
    sum (often used but could be confusing if context is unclear)
    
    Using these names can lead to misunderstanding, especially if they are commonly associated with specific functionalities.
