Q)  Define a rule to help decide if a conversion from one type to another is safe or unsafe.


A)  A general rule is:

    A conversion is safe if it doesnâ€™t result in a loss of data or precision (e.g., int to double is safe).
    
    A conversion is unsafe if it may cause a loss of information, data truncation, or change in data meaning (e.g., double to int, float to int, or long to short).
