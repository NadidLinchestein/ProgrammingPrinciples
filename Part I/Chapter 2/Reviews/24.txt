Q)  Why can conversion from double to int be a bad thing?


A)  Conversion from double to int can result in a loss of precision because the fractional part of the double value is truncated. 
    This can lead to inaccurate results if the exact value is required, and it may introduce bugs if the fractional part is significant in calculations.
