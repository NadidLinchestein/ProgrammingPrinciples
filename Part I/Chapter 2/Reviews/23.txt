Q)  What is type safety and why is it important?


A)  Type safety means that operations only involve compatible data types, preventing unexpected behavior and errors due to type mismatches. 
    Type safety helps ensure that the program behaves as expected and reduces the risk of runtime errors, making the code more reliable and easier to debug.
