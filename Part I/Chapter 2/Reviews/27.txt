Q)  What are the uses of auto?


A)  The auto keyword is used for automatic type deduction, where the compiler infers the variable’s type from its initializer. It is useful for:

    Reducing repetitive type declarations (e.g., with long or complex types).
    Improving readability by avoiding explicit type notation, especially in loops and complex initializations.
    Supporting more maintainable code, as changes to data types in the codebase won’t require updating auto declarations.
