Q)  How can we avoid undesirable conversions?


A)  To avoid undesirable conversions:

    Use type-safe casts (e.g., static_cast, dynamic_cast) instead of implicit casting.
    Use explicit types (avoid mixed-type operations unless necessary).
    Enable compiler warnings to detect and avoid implicit, potentially unsafe type conversions.
    Use auto for automatic type inference, reducing the need for explicit conversions.
