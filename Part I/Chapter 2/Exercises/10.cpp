/*
    Write a program that takes an operation followed by two operands and outputs the result. For example:
    + 100 3.14
    * 45

    Read the operation into a string called operation and use an if-statement to figure out
    which operation the user wants, for example, if (operation=="+"). Read the operands into variables of type double.
    Implement this for operations called +, âˆ’, *, /, plus, minus, mul, and div with their obvious meanings.
